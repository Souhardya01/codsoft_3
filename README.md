## ‚ú® Key Features  

### üîç Face Detection  
- Uses **Haarcascade models** for quick and lightweight face detection.  
- Detects multiple faces in a single frame and highlights them with bounding boxes.

### üß† Face Recognition  
- Employs **ArcFace embeddings** via the `face_recognition` library for accurate face identification.  
- Matches detected faces with preloaded known face encodings to identify individuals.

### üé• Real-Time Video Processing  
- Processes live video streams or video files frame-by-frame.  
- Simultaneously detects and recognizes multiple faces in real-time.

## üìÇ How It Works  

1. **Face Detection**  
   - Haarcascade models detect faces in grayscale frames from the input source.  

2. **Face Recognition**  
   - The application uses pre-trained ArcFace embeddings to encode faces.  
   - Detected faces are compared against known encodings for identification.  

3. **Live Video Processing**  
   - The application continuously reads video frames, detects faces, and recognizes individuals in real time.
